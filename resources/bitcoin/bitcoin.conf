# [core]
# Run in the background as a daemon and accept commands.
daemon=1

# [debug]
# Run this node on the Bitcoin Test Network. Equivalent to 
testnet=1

# Set the number of script verification threads. (1 to CPU_CORES, 0 = automatic, less than 0 = leave that many cores free).
par=1
# Reduce storage requirements by only storing most recent N MiB of block. This mode is incompatible with -txindex and -rescan. WARNING: Reverting this setting requires re-downloading the entire blockchain. (default: 0 = disable pruning blocks, 1 = allow manual pruning via RPC, greater than 550 = automatically prune blocks to stay under target size in MiB).
prune=550

# [rpc]
# Accept command line and JSON-RPC commands.
server=1
# Username and hashed password for JSON-RPC connections. The field <userpw> comes in the format: <USERNAME>:<SALT>$<HASH>. RPC clients connect using rpcuser=<USERNAME>/rpcpassword=<PASSWORD> arguments. You can generate this value with the ./share/rpcauth/rpcauth.py script in the Bitcoin Core repository. This option can be specified multiple times.
