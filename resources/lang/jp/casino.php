                                <p>Multiple accounts are not permitted. Creating more than one accounts with Casinobit
                                    in order to claim any bonuses is deemed as bonus abuse and may result in confiscated
                                    funds.</p>

                                <p>Bonus round and free spins do not qualify for the jackpot bonuses pursuant to casino

                                <p>Minimal risk bets on any games (i.e. betting in proportions on different outcomes in
                                    the same hand to create "action" with minimal risk) do not qualify for completing
                                    the wagering requirement. Examples of minimal risk bets include betting on red and
                                    black simultaneously in Roulette, and betting player and banker simultaneously in
                                    Baccarat. Players who are found to be adopting these practices risk of having their
                                    bonus and winnings confiscated. </p>
