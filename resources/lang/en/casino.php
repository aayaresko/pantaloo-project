Only bets made by using funds on the player’s bonus account balance will count towards the total wagering requirements.</div><div><br></div><div>1.10. Until the play through the bonus requirements&nbsp;(also referred to as the bonus requirements)&nbsp;have been met, the maximum bet that can be placed is 1.3 mBTC per bet. This includes the Gamble feature (doubles up the bet winnings) that may be found in some games. Failure to follow this condition may result in forfeiting any winnings.</div><div><br></div><div>1.11. Minimal-risk bets on any games (i.e. betting in proportions on different outcomes in the same hand to create "action" with minimal risk) do not qualify for completing the wagering requirements. The player who is found to be adopting these practices puts themselves at risk of having their bonus and winnings confiscated.</div><div><br></div><div>1.12. Winnings received using bonuses will be automatically credited to the player’s real account balance and available for withdrawal as soon as the player fulfills all the bonus requirements.</div><div><br></div><div>1.13. Any "free spin" or "bonus" winnings resulting from bonus funds after the bonus has been wagered, lost, or forfeited shall be removed.</div><div><br></div><div>1.14. Withdrawal is not possible while there is an active bonus. This means that the player has two options:&nbsp;</div><div>a) complete all bonus requirements for the bonus;</div><div>b) cancel the bonus.&nbsp;</div><div>Any bonus can be canceled by player prior to any wagering condition being met. If the player chooses to cancel the bonus, the bonus and all winnings attributed to the bonus will be lost.</div><div><br></div><div>1.15. All withdrawals&nbsp;requests will be subject to an internal audit before being processed. CasinoBit.io reserves all rights to cancel the bonuses or any winnings for failed audits.

If, upon such an audit, it appears that the player participates in strategies, takes advantage of any software or system bug or failure, or participates in any form of activity that CasinoBit.io, in its sole and complete discretion, deems to be abusive, CasinoBit.io reserves the right to cancel any bonuses and/or winnings obtained through fraudulent behavior and/or activities.</div><div><br></div><div>1.17.

Multiple accounts are not permitted at CasinoBit.io. Creating more than one account in order to claim any of the bonuses is considered as bonus abuse and will result in confiscated funds.</div><div><br></div><div>1.20. Any accounts that are identified to be linked to an account already claiming the bonus will not be eligible, and any bonuses credited to both accounts will be forfeited.</div><div><br></div><div>1.21.

If no transaction has been made to your player account at Casinobit.io in thirty months, your Account will be deemed as dormant and we will return your balance back to you. We\'ll make reasonable efforts trying to contact you regarding the withdrawal of the funds, but if we are not able to reach you, the funds will be retained by Casinobit.io Casino as an admin fee. <br>13.2. An inactive Account is the Account which a Player has not logged into or logged out of for twelve consecutive months. If your Account is deemed to be inactive, Casinobit.io reserves the right to charge a monthly administrative fee of 5 mBTC (or the current balance of your Account, if less) as long as the balance of your Account remains positive. You authorize Casinobit.io to debit this fee from your Account at the beginning of the month following the day on which your Account is deemed inactive, and at the beginning of every subsequent month that your Account remains inactive. Casinobit.io will stop deducting the fee if the account balance is zero or if the account is reactivated.<div><h3>14. MISCELLANEOUS<br></h3></div></span>14.1.
