If a player has an active bonus and attempts to place bets over the maximum allowed, the bonus and winnings will be forfeited.<span><br><br></span>5.7 Minimal risk bets on any games (i.e. betting in proportions on different outcomes in the same hand to create "action" with minimal risk) do not qualify for completing the wagering requirement. Examples of minimal risk bets include betting on red and black simultaneously in Roulette, and betting player and banker simultaneously in Baccarat. Players who are found to be adopting these practices risk of having their bonus and winnings confiscated.<span><br><br></span>5.8&nbsp;Only bets made using bonus money will count towards the total wagering requirement. Bonus money begins when your real balance is depleted.<span><br><br></span>5.9 Any "free spin" or "bonus" winnings resulting from bonus funds after the bonus has been wagered, lost or forfeited shall be removed.<span><br><br></span>5.10 Any bonus can be removed prior to any wagering conditions being met. Please contact the CasinoBit.io support to learn more.<span><br><br></span>5.11 All withdrawals will be subject to an internal audit before being processed. CasinoBit.io reserves all rights to void Bonuses or any winnings for failed audits. A player hereby consents in advance to the same.<span><br><br></span>5.12 If, upon such a review, it appears that a player participates in strategies, takes advantage of any software or system bug or failure, or participates &nbsp;in any form of activity that CasinoBit.io, in its sole and complete discretion, deems to be abusive (\'Promotion Abuse\'), CasinoBit.io reserves the right to revoke the entitlement of such a player to receive or benefit from the promotion (and/or withhold the pay out of the proceeds of such abuse to the player/s in question). Only fully settled bets (i.e. bets that result in a win or loss) will be counted towards wagering.<span><br><br></span>5.13 For no deposit bonus withdrawals, we reserve the right to request a KYC. Regarding the KYC (Know Your Customer), the following documents may be needed for verification: One government approved identity card (ID card, passport and driver\'s license) with a picture, as well as the proof of residency, such as a utility bill (which is not older than 2 months).<span><br><br></span>5.14 Players with disposable email addresses are not eligible for any bonus. If a player despite this would receive free spins, all winnings from the spins will be confiscated.<span><br><br></span>5.15 All customer offers are limited to one per person, family, household address, email address, telephone number, IP, and shared computer, e.g. public library or workplace.<span><br><br></span>5.16 If it\'s discovered that a group of players use &nbsp;the same betting patterns and are connected via (but not limited to) location, banking pattern or IP, the CasinoBit.io management will at its own discretion have the mandate to confiscate bonus winnings and/or a deposit.<span><br><br></span>5.17 Kindly note that it\'s not allowed to use bonus funds purely to progress through the bonus stages and then final stages completed with cash bets when bonus funds have been released or forfeited. If such a tactic is adopted, CasinoBit.io reserves the right to confiscate the winnings.<span><br><br></span>5.18 Any accounts that are identified to be linked to an account already claiming this promotion will not be eligible and any bonuses credited to both accounts will be forfeited.<span><br><br></span>5.19 Multiple accounts are not permitted. Creating more than one accounts with CasinoBit.io in order to claim any bonuses is deemed as bonus abuse and may result in confiscated funds.<span><br><br></span>5.20 In the event of any dispute, the decision of CasinoBit.io will be final.<span><br><br></span>5.21 The CasinoBit.io and Conditions as published on the Website (and updated from time to time) are in English, and it is the English version of these Terms and Conditions that forms the basis of these Terms and Conditions only.

ELIGIBILITY TO USE Casinobit.io’S SERVICES:</h3><span><br>2.1 You may participate in any of the Games if and only if:
You are over eighteen (18) years of age or such higher minimum legal age of majority as stipulated in the jurisdiction of Your residence; and
It is legal for You to participate in the Games according to applicable laws in the jurisdiction of your residence.<br><br></span>2.2&nbsp;<span>It is entirely and solely Your responsibility to enquire and ensure that You do not breach laws applicable to you by participating in the Games.<br><br><br></span><h3>3. YOUR MEMBER ACCOUNT<br></h3><span><br>3.1 In order for you to be able to place wagers using any of the Website, you must first register with Casinobit.io and open an account (“Member Account”).<br><br></span>3.2&nbsp;<span>You are allowed to have only one Member Account. Only one Account for each household, IP, PC is allowed. If you attempt to open more than one Member Account, all accounts you try to open may be blocked or closed and any bets may be voided. Also any returns, deposits, winnings or bonuses which you have gained or accrued during such time as the Duplicate Account was active will be forfeited by you and may be reclaimed by us, and you will return to us on demand any such funds which have been withdrawn from the Duplicate Account. If you wish to open another account, you may do so by contacting the Manager at support@Casinobit.io. If a new account is opened, the old account will be closed. If you notice that you have more than one registered Member Account you must notify us immediately. Failure to do so may lead to your Member account being blocked for access.<br><br></span>3.3&nbsp;<span>You must enter all mandatory information requested into your registration form, including a valid email address; if you do not enter a valid email address, we will be unable to help you recover any “forgotten passwords”. It is your sole responsibility to ensure that the information you provide is true, complete and correct.<br><br></span>3.4&nbsp;<span>As a part of the registration process You will have to type in Your email and password for Your login into the Website. It is Your sole and exclusive responsibility to ensure that Your login details are kept securely. You must not disclose Your login details to anyone. Casinobit.io is not responsible for any abuse or misuse of Your Member Account by third parties due to Your disclosure, whether intentional or accidental, whether active or passive, of your login details to any third party.<br><br></span>3.5&nbsp;<span>Casinobit.io reserves the right to refuse to register an Account or close Your Account. However all virtual funds within Your Account will be returned and all contractual obligations already made honoured.<br><br></span>3.6&nbsp;<span>Casinobit.io prohibits player collusion and do not allow any kind of robots and programmed devices to participate in game play. Casinobit.io reserves the right to void any game play which results from the use of robots and/or programmed devices.<br><br></span>3.7&nbsp;<span>Upon requesting a self exclusion, Casinobit.io will immediately close that account and prevent the player to play on that particular account. It\'s the player\'s responsibility to notify Casinobit.io of any other accounts the player might have and promise not to open any other accounts. Casinobit.io will make reasonable efforts to try to prevent the opening of new accounts but it\'s the player\'s sole responsibility to make sure no other accounts are created. Casinobit.io cannot be held accountable for potential losses on other accounts.<br><br><br></span><h3>4. DEPOSITS INTO YOUR MEMBER ACCOUNT</h3><span><br>4.1 You may only participate in Games if you have sufficient Virtual Funds on Your Member Account for such participation. For the avoidance of doubt, Virtual Funds shall mean Bitcoins. Casinobit.io will not grant any form of virtual credit whatsoever for participation in any of the Games.<br><br></span>4.2&nbsp;<span>Casinobit.io can, under certain circumstances, credit a player’s account with so called “bonus”. The conditions for the crediting of the bonus (e.g. 1st Deposit Bonus) and the amount of the bonus is determined by Casinobit.io and set out on the website. If an account contains both the Virtual Funds and bonus funds, the bonus funds will only be available for wagering once the existing Virtual Funds have been used. Before fulfilling the bonus turnover conditions if you transfer or withdraw the main deposit amount, bonus funds and all winnings from this bonus will be forfeited.<br><br></span>4.3&nbsp;<span>Casinobit.io is not a financial institution and thus should not be treated as such. Your account will not bear any interests.<br><br></span>4.4&nbsp;<span>Deposited amounts are available on the Account within a reasonable amount of time after the confirmation of the deposit. Before a withdrawal can be made, all previous deposits need to be confirmed.<br><br></span>4.5&nbsp;<span>We reserve the right to use additional procedures and means to verify your identity (Know Your Client) when effecting deposits into your Account. This could include (but is not limited to) a selfie with a document or form of identification.<br><br></span>4.6&nbsp;<span>It\'s the responsibility of the player to ensure that all documents as a part of the KYC process are genuine. Faked or fraudulent documents provided may result in a confiscation of deposits and potential winnings of the player.<br><br></span>4.7&nbsp;<span>Kindly note that bonuses come with specific bonus terms and conditions ("Bonus Terms and Conditions"). <br><br></span>4.8&nbsp;<span>We reserve the right to make a phone call to the number provided in your member account, which at our own discretion can be a necessary part of the KYC procedure. Until the account is fully verified, no cashouts will be processed.<br><br></span>4.9&nbsp;<span>You are able to opt out from receiving offers via emails from Casinobit.io. However, we still reserve the right to send you important information regarding your account, despite you being opted out from regular email send-outs.<br><br><br></span><h3>5. WITHDRAWALS FROM YOUR MEMBER ACCOUNT</h3><span><br>5.1 While Casinobit.io will endeavour to pay out withdrawals immediately, some withdrawals may take longer than others. Casinobit.io shall try to pay out withdrawals within 1 hour, however in some cases, withdrawals may take longer.<br><br></span>5.2&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin withdrawals will be made to your stated Casinobit.io wallet. To withdraw any Virtual Funds which have been deposited, we require the blockchain to give at a minimum 3 confirmation of your last deposit, before a withdrawal can be made. If you deposit with a small mining fee, 3 confirmation can take up to 35 min or more.<br><br></span>5.3&nbsp;<span>If we mistakenly credit your Member Account with winnings that do not belong to you, whether due to a technical problem, error in the pay-tables, or human error or otherwise, the amount will remain our property and will be deducted from your Member Account. If you have withdrawn funds that do not belong to you prior to us becoming aware of the error, the mistakenly paid amount will (without prejudice to other remedies and actions that may be available at law) constitute a debt owed by you to us. In the event of an incorrect crediting, you are obliged to notify us immediately by email.<br><br></span>5.4&nbsp;<span>You acknowledge that the Virtual Funds are consumed instantly and Casinobit.io do not provide for refunds or cancellation. Casinobit.io reserves the right to payout substantial wins in monthly installments.<br><br></span>5.5&nbsp;<span>Casinobit.io agents reserve the right to carry out additional verification procedures for any pay-out exceeding of 3 BTC or cumulative withdrawals exceeding 7 BTC, and further reserves the right to carry out such verification procedures also in case of lower pay-outs. Such verifications may for example include copies of a player’s passport, national identity card, copies of a player’s utility bills.<br><br></span>5.6&nbsp;<span>Players depositing from a BTC need to play through active deposited funds at least 3 times prior to withdrawing due to higher risk of fraud. If you are a table games player, 10x needs to be wagered. This procedure is in line with anti money laundering practices. The player is fully responsible for paying all fees and taxes applied to their winnings according to the laws of the jurisdiction of the player’s residence.<br><br></span>5.7&nbsp;<span>In the unlikely event of a player depositing crypto currency funds to another crypto currency network address (such as but not limited to: sending BTC to a BCH address). Casinobit.io will not attempt to recover the amount. <br><br></span>5.8&nbsp;<span>Upon a player winning a significant amount of money defined according to Casinobit.io\'s own discretion, the winnings will be needed to be verified with the relevant game provider. This means the withdrawal may take longer than the 10 minute average.<br><br><br></span><h3>6. CLOSING OF ACCOUNT</h3><span><br>6.1 You may close Your account by contacting customer support. Casinobit.io will return to You any and all funds from Your Member Account subject to the deduction of relevant withdrawal charges.<br><br></span>6.2&nbsp;<span>Casinobit.io reserves the right to close Your Member Account and to refund to You the "Account balance", subject to the deduction of relevant withdrawal charges, at Casinobit.io’s absolute discretion and without any obligation to state a reason or give prior notice.<br><br></span>6.3&nbsp;<span>If You do not log onto Your Member Account via the Internet, using Your "User Name" and "Password" for a period of one (1) year, all balances may be removed from Your account after a notification has been sent to the registered email address.<br><br><br></span><h3>7.

This means that players should be courteous to each other and avoid rude or obscene comments.<br><br></span>7.14&nbsp;<span>Some circumstances may arise where a wager is confirmed or a payment is performed by us in error. In all these cases Casinobit.io reserves the right to cancel all the wagers accepted containing such an error, or to correct the mistake made re-settling all the wagers at the correct prices/spreads/terms that should have been available at the time that the wager was placed in the absence of the error.<br><br></span>7.15&nbsp;<span>Should the user become aware of possible errors or incompleteness in the software, he/she agrees to refrain from taking advantage of them.

ADVANTAGE PLAY</h3><br>8.1 Should the Casino become aware of any user who has accepted the bonus or a promotion with the sole purpose of creating a positive expected value on bonus return by using known practices aimed at securing a cash out of said bonus or at any way try to take advantage of bonuses received by Casinobit.io, then Casinobit.io will enforce immediate confiscation of winnings and closure of the account with the right to withhold any further withdrawals. An example of advantage play would be delaying any game round in any game, including free spins features and bonus features, to a later time when you have no more wagering requirement and/or performing new deposit(s) while having free spins features or bonus features still available in a game. In the interests of fair gaming, equal, zero or low margin bets or hedge betting, shall all be considered irregular gaming for bonus play-through requirement purposes.
