Casinobit.io cannot be held accountable for potential losses on other accounts.</span><h3>DEPOSITS INTO YOUR MEMBER ACCOUNT</h3><span>You may only participate in Games if you have sufficient Virtual Funds on Your Member Account for such participation. For the avoidance of doubt, Virtual Funds shall mean Bitcoins. Casinobit.io will not grant any form of virtual credit whatsoever for participation in any of the Games.<br><br>Casinobit.io can, under certain circumstances, credit a player’s account with so called “bonus”. The conditions for the crediting of the bonus (e.g. 1st Deposit Bonus) and the amount of the bonus is determined by Casinobit.io and set out on the website. If an account contains both the Virtual Funds and bonus funds, the bonus funds will only be available for wagering once the existing Virtual Funds have been used.

If you deposit with a small mining fee, 3 confirmation can take up to 35 min or more.<br><br>If we mistakenly credit your Member Account with winnings that do not belong to you, whether due to a technical, error in the pay-tables, or human error or otherwise, the amount will remain our property and will be deducted from your Member Account. If you have withdrawn funds that do not belong to you prior to us becoming aware of the error, the mistakenly paid amount will (without prejudice to other remedies and actions that may be available at law) constitute a debt owed by you to us.

If you are a table games player, 10x needs to be wagered. This procedure is in line with anti money laundering practices. The player is fully responsible for paying all fees and taxes applied to their winnings according to the laws of the jurisdiction of the player’s residence.<br><br>In the unlikely event of a player depositing crypto currency funds to another crypto currency network address (such as but not limited to: sending BTC to a BCH address).
